## Sri Lanka's Innings
  
Sri Lanka won the toss and opted to bat first on a flat pitch. They got off to a shaky start as Zaheer Khan bowled a brilliant opening spell, taking the wicket of Upul Tharanga and conceding only six runs in his first five overs. Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan steadied the innings with a 62-run partnership before Dilshan was dismissed by Harbhajan Singh for 33.
  
Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene then added 62 more runs for the third wicket before Sangakkara fell to Yuvraj Singh for 48. Jayawardene then took charge of the innings and played a masterful knock of 103 not out off 88 balls, with 13 fours. He was well supported by Thilan Samaraweera (21), Chamara Kapugedera (1), Nuwan Kulasekara (32), and Thisara Perera (22 not out) as Sri Lanka posted a challenging total of 274 for six in 50 overs.
  
## India's Innings
  
India's chase got off to a disastrous start as Lasith Malinga removed both the openers, Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar, in his first four overs. Sehwag was trapped lbw for a duck on the second ball of the innings, while Tendulkar was caught behind for 18. India were reduced to 31 for two and the pressure was on.
  
Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli then rebuilt the innings with a crucial 83-run stand for the third wicket. Kohli played some fluent strokes and scored 35 off 49 balls before he was caught by Dilshan off Tillakaratne Dilshan's bowling. India were 114 for three in the 22nd over and needed a big partnership to stay in the hunt.
  
That's when MS Dhoni decided to promote himself ahead of Yuvraj Singh and joined Gambhir at the crease. The move proved to be a masterstroke as Dhoni and Gambhir shared a match-winning partnership of 109 runs for the fourth wicket. Gambhir played a gritty knock of 97 off 122 balls, with nine fours, before he was bowled by Perera in the 42nd over. He missed out on a deserved century but had brought India close to victory.
  
Dhoni then took over the chase and played one of his finest innings as captain. He was calm, composed, and confident as he smashed six fours and two sixes in his unbeaten knock of 91 off 79 balls. He was ably supported by Yuvraj Singh, who scored 21 not out off 24 balls. The duo added an unbeaten 54-run stand for the fifth wicket and sealed the deal for India.
