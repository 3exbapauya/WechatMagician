MyHeritage Family Tree Builder is a free genealogy program that helps you research your family history, build your family tree and add photos, historical records and more[^1^]. However, some features of the program require a paid subscription, such as Smart Matches, Record Matches, Instant Discoveries and DNA tools. If you want to access these features without paying, you might be tempted to look for a cracked version of the program online. But is it worth it?

In this article, we will explain why cracking MyHeritage Family Tree Builder is not a good idea, and what are the risks and alternatives you should consider.
 
## Why Cracking MyHeritage Family Tree Builder is a Bad Idea
 
Cracking software is the process of modifying it to remove or bypass its protection mechanisms, such as license keys, activation codes or digital rights management. Cracking software is illegal and unethical, as it violates the terms of use and the intellectual property rights of the software developers. Moreover, cracking software can have serious consequences for your computer and your personal data. Here are some of the reasons why cracking MyHeritage Family Tree Builder is a bad idea:
 
- **It can damage your computer.** Cracked software often comes with malware, viruses or spyware that can infect your computer and compromise its performance, security and stability. Malware can steal your personal information, delete or encrypt your files, display unwanted ads or pop-ups, or even take control of your computer remotely. You might end up spending more money and time on repairing your computer than on buying a legitimate subscription.
- **It can compromise your family tree.** Cracked software can also corrupt your family tree data or prevent you from syncing it with your online account. You might lose all your hard work and research, or expose it to unauthorized access or modification. You might also miss out on the latest updates and features of the program that can enhance your family history experience.
- **It can get you in trouble.** Cracking software is illegal and can get you in trouble with the law. You might face fines, lawsuits or even criminal charges for violating the copyright laws and the terms of use of the software. You might also damage your reputation and credibility as a genealogist or a family historian.

## What are the Alternatives to Cracking MyHeritage Family Tree Builder
 
If you want to enjoy the full benefits of MyHeritage Family Tree Builder without cracking it, here are some alternatives you should consider:

- **Use a free trial.** If you are not sure whether you want to buy a subscription or not, you can use a free trial to test the features of the program for a limited time. MyHeritage offers a 14-day free trial for its Complete plan, which includes all the features of the program and unlimited access to its historical records collection.

You can use free websites, databases, libraries, archives or forums to find information about your ancestors and relatives. You can also use free software or apps to create and share your family tree online or offline. However, keep in mind that free resources might have limitations in quality, quantity or accuracy compared to paid ones.
