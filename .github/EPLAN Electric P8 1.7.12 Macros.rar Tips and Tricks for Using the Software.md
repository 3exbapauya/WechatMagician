Macros are reusable blocks of data that contain symbols, connections, texts, and attributes. You can create your own macros or use the ones provided by EPLAN or by various manufacturers. Macros can help you save time, avoid errors, and ensure consistency in your projects.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use EPLAN Electric P8 macros for efficient electrical design. We will cover the following topics:
 
- What are EPLAN Electric P8 macros and how to access them
- How to import macros from external sources
- How to create and edit your own macros
- How to use macros in your projects

## What are EPLAN Electric P8 macros and how to access them
 
EPLAN Electric P8 macros are files that contain data for symbols, connections, texts, and attributes. They have the extension .edz or .ema. You can use macros to insert predefined elements into your schematics or panel layouts.
 
EPLAN Electric P8 comes with a library of macros that you can access from the Macro navigator. To open the Macro navigator, go to View > Windows > Macro navigator. You can also use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+M.

The Macro navigator shows you the available macro categories and subcategories. You can expand or collapse them by clicking on the plus or minus signs. You can also search for a specific macro by typing its name in the search box.
 
To insert a macro into your project, simply drag and drop it from the Macro navigator to the desired location in your schematic or panel layout. You can also double-click on a macro to open its properties dialog box, where you can modify its settings before inserting it.
  
## How to import macros from external sources
 
Besides the macros that come with EPLAN Electric P8, you can also import macros from external sources. For example, you can download macros from the EPLAN Data Portal, which is an online platform that provides data for thousands of products from various manufacturers.
 
To access the EPLAN Data Portal, go to Utilities > EPLAN Data Portal. You can also use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P. You will need an internet connection and an EPLAN account to use this feature.
 
The EPLAN Data Portal shows you the available products and categories. You can browse or search for a specific product by typing its name or part number in the search box. You can also filter the results by manufacturer, product group, or country.
 
To download a macro from the EPLAN Data Portal, simply select it and click on the Download button. You can also double-click on a macro to open its details page, where you can see more information about it.
 
After downloading a macro from the EPLAN Data Portal, you can find it in your local macro directory. To open your local macro directory, go to View > Windows > Macro directory. You can also use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+D.
 
The Macro directory shows you the macros that you have downloaded or imported from other sources. You can organize them into folders or subfolders as you wish. You can also rename or delete them by right-clicking on them and choosing the appropriate option.
 
To insert a macro from your local macro directory into your project, simply drag and drop it from the Macro directory to the desired location in your schematic or panel layout. You can also double-click on a macro to open its properties dialog box, where you can modify its settings before inserting it.
  
## How to create and edit your own macros
 
If you want to create your own macros, you can do so by using the Macro editor. To open the Macro editor, go to Utilities > Macro editor. You can also use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+E.
 
The Macro editor allows you to create new macros or edit existing ones. You can add symbols, connections, texts,
